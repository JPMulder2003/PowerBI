# PowerBI
Here are some PowerBI Projects, nothing fancy, just the templates and the PowerBI files
for project I am uploading to my Portfolio

1. AirBnB Cape Town
   * Due to Limitations on free to use PowerBI and inability to make the dashboard viewable online, simply download the .pbix file and the cleaned.xlsx file
   * Now Open the AirBnB Cape Town.pbix file, and no dashboard will be visible.
       * Simply Click on Transform Data in the Home Tab
       * Select Data Source Settings
       * The click on Change Source
       * Browse and Navigate to the cleaned.xlsx file downloaded earlier
       * Click OK
       * Click Close
       * On the Banner, you just need to Click on the Apply Change
    
   * The .pbit is a template of the Dashboard
   * Icluded are the Raw.csv file that was obtained from Kaggle
     
2. TBA
